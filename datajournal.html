    <h1>Your Superfund: Data Journal</h1>
    <p><a href='/superfund/'>Your Superfund</a> uses EPA data
      for a country-wide map of superfund sites. Mostly it was
      a great experience using data! The EPA is doing a fine job
      of open data. Here are a few quick notes.</p>

      <p>The main open/fast data format that's offered is <strong>Shapefiles</strong>.
      Which are great as far as being accessible from lots of software,
      but they're very inefficient with this type of data - the <code>dbf</code>
      is 1.3GB, because shapefile fields don't compress with small data.
      Though it's kind of obscure, an SQLite or Spatialite version would
      be more efficient.</p>

      <p>It would be awesome if the Geospatial Data Access Project
      page had more links, like <a href='http://www.epa.gov/superfund/'>to the
        main Superfund site</a>. They're rather hard to discover from each
      other, and the main site has its own data downloads which are useful.</p>

      <p>There are quite a few different search services -
      <a href='http://ds.io/u5pm0d'>a regional one</a>, the
      <a href='http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/query/queryhtm/nplfin.htm'>National Priorities List</a>,
      and, of course, the site search. There's probably plenty of reason that they're
      all necessary, but having them have different interfaces with not enough
      context of what you're searching makes the user experience a little
      daunting.</p>

      <p>The datasource I found for basically narratives of actions on each site
      includes an EPA ID and a site ID, but has nothing about a CERCID. The differences
      between the two, and some kind of concordance between EPA IDs and CERC IDs
      would be vital for linking the datasets. (still trying to dig up
      where exactly I found that source - I should have recorded that in the first place)</p>
